QR code linking of e-contents using Node.js:

Setup: Ensure Node.js is installed on the machine where you'll be conducting the POC.

Initialize the project: Create a new Node.js project and set up the necessary dependencies using npm or yarn.

Generate QR codes: Utilize a QR code library, such as qrcode or node-qrcode, to generate QR codes programmatically. You can generate QR codes containing URLs, text, or any other content you want to link.

Create a web server: Use a Node.js web framework like Express.js to set up a basic web server that will handle HTTP requests.

API endpoints: Create API endpoints to generate QR codes and retrieve the linked e-contents.

Generate QR code: /api/qrcode/generate (POST) - This endpoint should accept the content to be encoded and generate a QR code image.
Retrieve e-content: /api/qrcode/:id (GET) - This endpoint should accept the QR code identifier (e.g., ID or filename) and return the linked e-content.
Store e-contents: Determine how you want to store the e-contents associated with each QR code. You could use a file storage system or a database like MongoDB.

Frontend: Develop a simple frontend interface where users can enter the content they want to link and generate QR codes. Use a frontend framework like React or Angular.js to build the interface.

Linking e-contents: When a user generates a QR code, store the associated e-content (URL, text, etc.) in your chosen storage mechanism (file system or database) along with a unique identifier.

QR code display: Display the generated QR code to the user, either as an image on the webpage or by providing a download link.

Retrieve e-contents: When a user scans a QR code, the associated e-content should be retrieved from the storage based on the QR code identifier.

Testing: Test the QR code generation, storage, retrieval, and rendering functionalities. Ensure that the QR codes are scannable and that the linked e-contents are correctly displayed.
